Abstract
This document reviews basic linked list code techniques and then works through 18 linked list problems covering a wide range of difficulty. Most obviously, these problems are a way to learn about linked lists. More importantly, these problems are a way to develop your ability with complex pointer algorithms. Even though modern languages and tools have made linked lists pretty unimportant for day-to-day programming, the skills for complex pointer algorithms are very important, and linked lists are an excellent way to develop those skills.
The problems use the C language syntax, so they require a basic understanding of C and its pointer syntax. The emphasis is on the important concepts of pointer manipulation and linked list algorithms rather than the features of the C language. For some of the problems we present multiple solutions, such as iteration vs. recursion, dummy node vs. local reference. The specific problems are,in rough order of difficulty: Count GetNth DeleteList Pop InsertNth SortedInsert InsertSort Append FrontBackSplit RemoveDuplicates MoveNode AlternatingSplit ShuffleMerge SortedMerge SortedIntersect Reverse and RecursiveReverse.
